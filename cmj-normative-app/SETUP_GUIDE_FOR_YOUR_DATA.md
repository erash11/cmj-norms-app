# How to Use Your Actual Data Files

## ‚úÖ Your Data is Ready!

Your files are **perfect** and will work great! Here's what we found:

### üìä Data Summary
- **CMJ Records**: 6,023 jump tests
- **Unique Athletes Tested**: 114
- **Athletes in Roster**: 116
- **Matching Athletes**: 114 (98% match rate!)
- **Positions**: 13 different positions (CB, DL, K, LB, LS, OL, OLB, P, QB, RB, S, TE, WR)

### üéØ Column Selections for the App

When you use the app, select these columns:

1. **Athlete ID Column**: `Name`
2. **CMJ Metric Column**: `Jump Height (Imp-Mom) in Inches [in]`
3. **Position Column**: `Position`

## üì• Files to Use

I've created cleaned versions of your files (removed extra spaces):

### Option 1: Use Cleaned Files (Recommended)
- [CMJ_Data_Cleaned.csv](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/CMJ_Data_Cleaned.csv) ‚≠ê
- [Roster_Cleaned.csv](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Roster_Cleaned.csv) ‚≠ê

### Option 2: Use Original Files
- Your original files will work too once you update the app.py

## üîß Update the App

**IMPORTANT**: Download and push the updated app.py that automatically cleans column names:

1. [Download Updated app.py](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/cmj-normative-app/app.py)
2. Replace in your GitHub repo
3. Wait for Streamlit to redeploy (2-3 minutes)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Update GitHub with New app.py
```bash
# Download the app.py from the link above
# Then replace it in your repo and commit

git add cmj-normative-app/app.py
git commit -m "Fix column name space trimming"
git push
```

### 2. Wait for Deployment
- Go to cmj-norms.streamlit.app
- Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic update
- You'll see "App is up to date" message

### 3. Upload Your Files
1. Upload **CMJ_Data_Cleaned.csv**
2. Upload **Roster_Cleaned.csv**

### 4. Select Columns
In the sidebar configuration:
- **Athlete ID Column**: Select `Name`
- **CMJ Metric Column**: Select `Jump Height (Imp-Mom) in Inches [in]`
- **Position Column**: Select `Position`

### 5. View Results! üéâ
You should see:
- ‚úÖ 6,023 records ready for analysis
- ‚úÖ Normative values table by position
- ‚úÖ Individual athlete performance rankings
- ‚úÖ Export buttons for CSV and Excel

## üìä What You'll Get

### Normative Values by Position
For each position (CB, DL, K, LB, etc.), you'll see:
- Sample size (N)
- Mean jump height
- Standard deviation
- Percentiles (P25, P50, P75, P90)
- Min and Max values

### Individual Athlete Rankings
For each athlete:
- Name
- Position  
- Jump height
- Percentile rank within their position
- Performance category (Elite, Above Average, Average, Below Average)

### Position Breakdown
- **CB** (Cornerback): 10 athletes, 639 tests
- **DL** (Defensive Line): 16 athletes, 742 tests
- **K** (Kicker): 3 athletes, 148 tests
- **LB** (Linebacker): 8 athletes, 395 tests
- **LS** (Long Snapper): 2 athletes, 124 tests
- **OL** (Offensive Line): 16 athletes, 988 tests
- **OLB** (Outside Linebacker): 6 athletes, 287 tests
- **P** (Punter): 1 athlete, 109 tests
- **QB** (Quarterback): 5 athletes, 316 tests
- **RB** (Running Back): 7 athletes, 315 tests
- **S** (Safety): 16 athletes, 912 tests
- **TE** (Tight End): 6 athletes, 484 tests
- **WR** (Wide Receiver): 18 athletes, 564 tests

## üéØ Expected Results Preview

Based on your data, here's what you should see:

**Jump Height Range**: 6.9 to 28.8 inches
**Average Jump Height**: 16.5 inches
**Most Tested Position**: OL (988 tests)
**Highest Jumping Position**: Usually WR, RB, or CB
**Most Athletes**: WR (18 athletes)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The 2 Missing Athletes

Your roster has 2 athletes who haven't been tested yet:
- They'll appear in the roster but won't have CMJ data
- The app will show a warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è 2 athletes found in CMJ data without position information"
- This is normal and expected!
- The analysis will still work perfectly for the 114 athletes who HAVE been tested

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Multiple Tests per Athlete**: Your data has multiple tests per athlete (average of 53 tests each!). The app will calculate normative values using ALL tests, giving you comprehensive statistics.

2. **Export Options**: Once results appear, you can download:
   - Normative values (CSV)
   - Individual results (CSV)
   - Complete analysis (Excel with multiple sheets)

3. **Position Comparisons**: The normative table will clearly show which positions have higher/lower jump heights on average.

4. **Elite Performers**: Athletes in the P90+ (top 10%) will be marked as "Elite" in the individual results.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No valid data to analyze"
**Solution**: Make sure you selected the correct columns:
- Athlete ID: `Name` (not "Name ")
- Metric: `Jump Height (Imp-Mom) in Inches [in]` (look for this exact text)
- Position: `Position`

### "Column not found" error
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure you updated app.py on GitHub
2. Use the cleaned CSV files I provided
3. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Names don't match
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen with your data! 114/114 athletes match perfectly.

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Downloaded updated app.py
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Waited for Streamlit deployment
- [ ] Downloaded CMJ_Data_Cleaned.csv
