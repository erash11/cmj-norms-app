4. **Display**: Shows interactive tables with color coding
5. **Export**: Allows download in multiple formats

## 🎨 User Interface Highlights

### Sidebar
- File upload controls
- Column name configuration
- Clear instructions

### Main Area
- Data preview section (split view)
- Normative values table (color-coded)
- Individual performance rankings
- Summary statistics cards
- Export buttons

### Features
- No scrolling needed for key info
- Responsive layout
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Helpful tooltips and instructions

## 📈 Sample Output

For a team of 20 athletes across 3 positions (Guard, Forward, Center):

**Normative Values Table**
- Rows: Each position + overall
- Columns: N, Mean, SD, Min, P25, P50, P75, P90, Max
- Color-coded by percentile values

**Individual Results Table**
- All athletes ranked by percentile
- Shows position, metric value, percentile rank, category
- Sortable by any column

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Streamlit 1.28+
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.0+
- **Statistics**: NumPy 1.24+
- **Excel Support**: OpenPyXL 3.1+
- **Python**: 3.8+

## 💡 Customization Options

The app is highly customizable:

1. **Column Names**: Configure via sidebar
2. **Metrics**: Works with any numeric performance metric
3. **Positions**: Supports any position structure
4. **Styling**: Easy to modify colors and layout
5. **Analysis**: Simple to add new statistical measures

## 🎯 Use Cases

✅ Strength & conditioning monitoring
✅ Athlete benchmarking
✅ Return-to-play testing
✅ Talent identification
✅ Research data analysis
✅ Team performance reporting

## 📝 Data Requirements

### Minimal CMJ Data File
- Athlete identifier (name or ID)
- Performance metric (e.g., jump height in cm)

### Minimal Roster File
- Athlete identifier (matching CMJ data)
- Position

Both files can have additional columns - they'll be preserved in the raw data export.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements (Optional)

The codebase is structured to easily add:
- Multi-metric support
- Time-series analysis
- Charts and graphs
- Z-score calculations
- Custom report generation
- Database integration
- User authentication
