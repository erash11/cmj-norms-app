# Version 2.2.0 - Simplified Single Name Column

## 🎯 What Changed

You mentioned you've removed split name columns and now only have a single "Name" column in both files. Perfect! I've updated the code to reflect this simplified structure.

## ✂️ Removed Features

**Removed all name combination logic:**
- ❌ Automatic detection of First Name / Last Name columns
- ❌ `detect_name_columns()` function
- ❌ `combine_name_columns()` function
- ❌ All auto-combination code on file upload
- ❌ Info messages about detected split names

## ✅ What Remains (Core Functionality)

**Clean, simple column selection:**
1. Upload CMJ data file (with single "Name" column)
2. Upload Roster file (with single "Name" column)
3. Select columns from dropdowns:
   - Athlete ID Column (CMJ Data) → Select "Name"
   - Metric Column → Select your jump metric
   - Position Column (Roster) → Select "Position"
4. View results!

## 📊 Your Data Structure (Now Simplified)

### CMJ Data File
```csv
Name, Jump Height, Date, Position...
John Smith, 18.5, 2025-10-01, WR
Jane Doe, 20.2, 2025-10-01, CB
...
```

### Roster File
```csv
Name, Position, Jersey Number
John Smith, WR, 12
Jane Doe, CB, 24
...
```

Both files now have matching "Name" columns - simple and clean!
