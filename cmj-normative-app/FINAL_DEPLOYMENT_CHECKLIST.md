## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: App still shows error after update
**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub - make sure the new code is there
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for full deployment
3. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
4. Clear Streamlit cache: Click ⋮ menu → "Clear cache" → "Rerun"

### Issue: "No valid data to analyze"
**Solution:**
- Use the **cleaned CSV files** I provided
- Make sure column selections are EXACT:
  - `Name` (not "Name " with space)
  - `Jump Height (Imp-Mom) in Inches [in]` (look for this exact text)
  - `Position`

### Issue: Column not in dropdown
**Solution:**
- Make sure you uploaded the **cleaned** versions of the files
- The updated app strips spaces automatically
- Try re-uploading the files

### Issue: Names don't match
**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen with your data (114/114 match perfectly)
- If it does, check that you're using the cleaned files
- Verify names are spelled exactly the same in both files

## 📈 What Each Metric Means

Your CMJ data includes these metrics (in case you want to analyze others later):

### Primary Metrics
- **Jump Height**: Vertical jump height in inches (most common metric)
- **RSI-modified**: Reactive Strength Index (power/time ratio)
- **Peak Power**: Maximum power output in watts
- **Vertical Velocity at Takeoff**: Speed at jump initiation

### Force Metrics
- **Concentric Peak Force**: Maximum force during upward phase
- **Eccentric Peak Force**: Maximum force during downward phase
- **Peak Power**: Maximum power during jump

### Timing Metrics
- **Contraction Time**: Duration of upward phase
- **Flight Time**: Time in the air
- **Eccentric Duration**: Duration of downward phase

### Depth Metrics
- **Countermovement Depth**: How deep the athlete dips

All these metrics are available in your data and can be analyzed by changing the "CMJ Metric Column" selection!

## 🎯 Use Cases for Your Results

### For Coaching Staff
1. **Position-Specific Standards**: Know what's "good" for each position
2. **Identify Outliers**: Find athletes significantly above/below position norms
3. **Training Program Design**: Target improvements for below-average athletes
4. **Recruiting Benchmarks**: Know what to look for in recruits

### For Strength & Conditioning
1. **Track Progress**: Compare tests over time
2. **Identify Weaknesses**: Athletes below P25 need attention
3. **Validate Training**: See if interventions improve percentiles
4. **Position Comparisons**: Understand positional requirements

### For Sports Science
1. **Research Data**: Publish normative values for college football
2. **Injury Risk**: Lower jump height may correlate with injury risk
3. **Performance Prediction**: Jump height correlates with game performance
4. **Load Management**: Track fatigue through jump testing

## 📊 Sample Insights You Might Find

Based on typical college football data:

### Position Trends
- **WR, RB, CB**: Usually highest jumpers (17-19" average)
- **OL, DL**: Usually lower jumpers (15-17" average)
- **Skill positions**: More variance (wider percentile ranges)
- **Linemen**: More consistent (narrower percentile ranges)

### Elite Performers
- **>P90 (Elite)**: ~11 athletes in top 10%
- **>P95**: ~6 athletes in top 5%
- **>P99**: 1-2 exceptional athletes

### Development Targets
- **<P25**: ~29 athletes need improvement
- **<P10**: ~11 athletes need significant focus
